I’m going to be making a variation of snake in unity.
It’s going to be 3d and is currently undecided if I can do multiple levels or just one level.

In the game of Snake, the player uses the arrow keys to move a "snake" around the board. As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger. The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself. The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens.

I’m looking to add educational elements to it by adding prompts whenever the player “eats the food”, giving the player points and a “power-up”. The game doesn’t necessarily have to be where you become as large as possible, but I will be looking for other ways to make the levels harder because in snake you lose if you hit/eat yourself. One of the early ideas is to have the player increase in speed with each “food” and make the walls “deadly”, having the player be challenged with momentum and  Depending on how I can implement this I’ll see if I make it a heart system where they get tries between getting answers wrong and hitting walls or just a heart system for the educational prompts and just one life outside the prompts. 

The goal is to either get a high score or finish the levels.

For powerup/reward ideas I have that: the typical bonus health / heart, slowing the ball down, spawning a bunch of “foods”, 2x points for the next few questions.
